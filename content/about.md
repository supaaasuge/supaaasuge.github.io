Hello! I'm Evan Pardon, known as supaaasuge online. I'm an aspiring IT and Cybersecurity professional with a keen interest in Web3, DevOps/Sysadmin, Cryptography, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I'm pursuing an associate degree at [Oakland Community College](https://www.oaklandcc.edu/). I have experience in Python, bash scripting, and Linux system administration.


I am an avid Capture The Flag (CTF) enthusiast and member of [Team L3ak](https://l3ak.team/). Our team collaborates to tackle various categories of CTF challenges almost every weekend. This experience has honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of cybersecurity related topics.

## What You Can Expect on This Site

On this site, you'll find:
- **CTF Write-ups**: Detailed accounts of challenges I've solved or created.

As a wise man (*not sure who... but someone*) once said, *"The most effective way to retain knowledge is to pass it on and share."* This platform embodies that belief, aiming to inspire others by documenting my academic and professional journey.

## My Philosophy

I firmly believe that with adequate time and resources, no task is too complex to tackle. In cybersecurity, staying proactive and keeping up with current trends is crucial for protecting an organization. Therefore, I am committed to lifelong learning, continually updating myself with the latest advancements in software engineering and cybersecurity to stay ahead of the curve.
