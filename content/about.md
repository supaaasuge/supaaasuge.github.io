Hello! I'm Evan Pardon, known as supasuge online. I'm an aspiring IT and Cybersecurity professional with a keen interest in Electrical Engineering, InfoSec, DevOps/System Administration, Cryptography, AI, and Pentesting/Red Teaming. Currently I'm pursuing an associate degree in Cybersecurity at [Oakland Community College](https://www.oaklandcc.edu/), with plans to continue my education at a four-year institution.

I have experience in Python programming, bash scripting, Linux System Administration, and limited experience with Windows System Administration. These skills among others form a strong foundation for my technical expertise and are essential in my journey towards becoming a well-rounded, respected cybersecurity professional.

As a dedicated Capture The Flag (CTF) enthusiast and member of [Team L3ak](https://l3ak.team/), I regularly participate in CTF events, which sharpen my problem-solving abilities and deepen my understanding of real-world security scenarios. Our team collaborates to tackle various categories of CTF challenges almost every weekend, honing our technical knowledge, problem-solving skills and staying updated with the latest trends & techniques in cybersecurity.
